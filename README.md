# GraphApplication

Some graph samples and some graph algorithms.

User can manually surf in the graph.

Implemented algorithms:
- Dijkstra

Todo:
- add some errors handling 
- add a menu and some interactions with the user
- read graphs from file
- save graphs on file
- check if the graph is correct for Dijkstra (no negative edges)
- more testing
